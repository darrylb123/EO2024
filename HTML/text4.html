<h1>Tasmota</h1>
<ul>
<li>Tasmota was first called Sonoff-MQTT-OTA, first commit in 2016 by Theo Arends.</li>
<li>Tasmota grew into a fully fledged ecosystem for virtually any ESP8266/ESP32 based device.</li>
<li>Tasmota was not designed for Home Assistant, although it eventually grew to interface to it. It is not really comparable with ESPHome.</li>
<li>A Tasmota device can be stand alone</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>- Tasmota began as Sonoff-MQTT-OTA with a commit on 25th January 2016, by Theo Arends. Its goal was to provide ESP8266 based ITEAD Sonoff devices with MQTT and 'Over the Air' or OTA firmware.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>- What started as a simple way to hack a cloud bound Sonoff Basic (one of the first cheap and accessible smart home devices in the market) into a locally controlled device has grown into a fully fledged ecosystem for virtually any ESP8266/ESP32 based device.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Tasmota capabilities overlap with ESPHome and interfaces with home assistant via MQTT and HA auto-configuration.</p>
