<h3>Notes:</h3><br>

<p><p>- Tasmota began as Sonoff-MQTT-OTA with a commit on 25th January 2016, by Theo Arends. Its goal was to provide ESP8266 based ITEAD Sonoff devices with MQTT and 'Over the Air' or OTA firmware.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>- What started as a simple way to hack a cloud bound Sonoff Basic (one of the first cheap and accessible smart home devices in the market) into a locally controlled device has grown into a fully fledged ecosystem for virtually any ESP8266/ESP32 based device.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Tasmota capabilities overlap with ESPHome and interfaces with home assistant via MQTT and HA auto-configuration.</p>
